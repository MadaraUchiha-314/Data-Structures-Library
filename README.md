Data-Structures-Library
=======================

Whenever a budding programmer is introduced to Data-Structures And Algorithms, they wish to implement these themselves.
I am one of those. I learnt a lot lot lot of programming implementing the Standard Libraries Of C++.
The code is for those who wish to explore on how thing are working behind the scenes.

The code is mostly STL Compactible ie. the naming conventions are the same as C++ STL. This not only enhances the readablity of a programmer who wants to relate this lirary with the STL and improve upon certain features.

Also following the same naming conventions as C++ STL has another advantage that to test one container we can use other container of STL already made. Also some STL libraries like the priority_queue requires certain naming functions of the inlying container, so i have adapted to the naming conventions of the STL.

The the code also contains the main () program which is just to test the library made.
The main () can be used and modified as per the requirments of the developer.

Currently Implemented Data Structures Are :

1. Linked List 
2. Stack 
3. Vector
4. Binary Search Tree (BST)
5. An Extensive Graph Library
6. Segment Tree

Currently Working On :

1. Queue - Both Normal and Priority
2. Heap
3. Balanced BST
